# Welcome to my portfolio! 91am.github.io

I wanted to create a simple but interesting portfolio in dark mode that evokes the nostalgia of the 80s video games in a contemporary way.

Pixel retro minimal often embraces simplicity, exaggerated minimalism and nostalgia. It uses basic elements which are represented with square blocks, bold use of typography a limited of monochromatic palette, and some bright color in some unexpected way which creates a retro aesthetic. 

Navigation is simple and straightforward, focused on providing information clearly and efficiently.

This is the first version, I'll be working on it, adding projects and improving the code. Meanwhile, I hope you enjoy these firs steps I made to develop this page.
